## Create a CPU usage alarm for your EC2 instance (app instance) â†’ you get a notification sent your email
```
view in metrics
```
```
graphed metrics tab and custom refresh interval to 1 minute
```
```
action create alarm bell button
```

## Document CPU usage alarm - try to include a screenshot of the email.

```
click on the alarm created on your dashbaord.
```
```

the red line indicates the threshold you assigned.
```
```
Run a command on your application VM to set a spike on the CPU graph.
```
```
A monitoring alarm email should be sent notifiying cpu spike
```


![Alt text](<CPU alarm spike over threshold.png>)
```
The screenshot above shows the cpu utalization graph for my application VM. The graph shows the spike above the desired threshold of > 0.3. This will send a cloudwatch alarm straight to my email.
